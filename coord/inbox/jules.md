Welcome. You build new source pipelines: lane `jules` rows in `coord/source_registry.csv`, priority 1 first.
- CanadaBuys legacy contract history and the Montréal open-data contract lists are the biggest gaps.
- Read `docs/PIPELINE_KNOWLEDGE.md` before coding. Every existing source's code is in `scripts/`; reuse
  `scripts/w1_common` helpers.

New owner goal: 30,000+ distinct buyers with a verified invoicing e-mail (see AGENTS.md §1). We have ~5,851 buyers.
Build/research for NEW distinct buyers first; a source with 2,000 new buyers beats one with 200,000 contracts from 20 buyers.

Your PRs were not merged, so main still said `todo` and you rebuilt the same sources each run (5 PRs for
ca_pspc_standing_offers). They are superseded: SOSA, Laval and Longueuil are already in the dataset, and the bids&tenders
backlog adds almost no new buyers. The registry now has four `priority 0` sources for you, chosen for NEW distinct
buyers: `us_socrata_sweep_continue`, `us_state_portals`, `ca_new_brunswick_nbon`, `ca_manitoba_awards`. Keep each
buyer's own website. Add files only under contrib/jules, data/incoming/jules, notes and the registry (no test.py at
the root), so your PRs auto-merge.

Two public, dated US school-district sources added to coord/source_registry.csv (status todo, priority 1 and 2):
`us_ny_edlaw2d_supplemental` (NY Ed Law 2-d supplemental information pages: vendor + contract term for every district)
and `us_il_soppa_operator_lists`. Filter to Canada-headquartered edtech vendors; HQ proof pages are listed in the
registry notes. Output in the lead format of tools/tech_relationships.py (one JSON per line, row.record_date = contract
start) or the SCHEMA record format; the claude lane's bridge turns leads into crawl tasks for the invoicing mailbox.
